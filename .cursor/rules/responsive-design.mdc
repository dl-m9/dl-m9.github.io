# Responsive Design Implementation

This academic website is built with comprehensive responsive design considerations to ensure optimal viewing across all devices.

## Media Queries

The [styles.css](mdc:styles.css) file contains several media queries for different screen sizes:

- Mobile devices (< 768px)
- Tablets (768px - 1024px)
- Desktop (> 1024px)

## Mobile Navigation

The mobile navigation features:
- Horizontal scrolling for menu items
- Active link centering
- Condensed header with optimized spacing
- Touch-friendly interactive elements

## Responsive Components

Each section is carefully designed to adapt to different screen sizes:

### Header
- Stacked layout on mobile (profile info above profile image)
- Side-by-side layout on larger screens

### Publications
- Simplified layout on mobile
- Adjustable column width for different screen sizes

### Timeline (Education)
- Vertical orientation that works well on all devices
- Responsive spacing between timeline items

### Services & Honors
- Multi-column on desktop
- Single column on mobile

## Responsive Images

- Profile and logo images are sized appropriately for different screens
- Use of relative units (%, em, rem) for flexible scaling

## Testing Responsive Design

When modifying the website, always test on:
1. Mobile devices (portrait and landscape)
2. Tablets
3. Desktop screens of various sizes

Use browser dev tools to simulate different device sizes during development.
