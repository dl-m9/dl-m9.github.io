# JavaScript Functionality

The [script.js](mdc:script.js) file powers all dynamic content and interactions on the website.

## Core Functions

### Content Loading
- `loadProfileInfo()`: Loads and renders personal information from profile-info.json
- `loadPublications()`: Loads and renders publications from publications.json, organized by type
- `renderNewsItems()`: Renders news items from news.json, with different behavior for homepage and all-news page

### Interactive Features
- Publication filtering (All/Preprints/Accepted/First Author)
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Active link tracking during scrolling
- Mobile-friendly navigation handling

## Event Listeners

The script sets up several event listeners:
- DOM content loaded event: Initializes all functionality
- Click events on filter buttons: For publication filtering
- Click events on navigation links: For smooth scrolling
- Scroll events: For updating active navigation links

## JSON Data Processing

Each JSON file is processed to dynamically generate HTML content:
1. Fetch data from JSON file
2. Process and organize the data
3. Generate HTML elements
4. Insert elements into the DOM

## Responsive Behavior

JavaScript also handles some aspects of responsive behavior:
- Path adjustments for JSON files based on current page
- Special handling for section visibility during filtering
